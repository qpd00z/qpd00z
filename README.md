Hi, I’m @qpd00z,

I'm especially interested in STEM education for young people. That's why most of the projects here are meant for educational purposes.

When declared as educational project, code is mostly kept quite simple, as it was either co-developed by programming beginners or is aimed at such.
So, if you are looking for perfect snippets please visit other places.

qpd00z/qpd00z is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
